# ShellHax

ShellHax is a group of client side modifications including Aimbot, ESP, Tracers, and Chat spam.

You can enable those features via the following keybinds:


- B: Aimbot
- V: ESP
- N: Tracers
- L: Toggle Aimbot with right click
- U: Toggle Chat spam
- Y: Change message to be spammed
- H: Bring up help menu

This code was based off of a Client By Zertalious. My issue with it was that it seemed quite basic, and every time you reloaded you were baraged by ads.
